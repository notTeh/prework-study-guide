# <PreWork Study Guide Website>

## Description

- What was your motivation? To create a webpage with all my notes from the prework, easily accessible, all in the same place for an easier way to study and learn. 
- Why did you build this project? To practice the fundimentals of becoming a web developer. In addition to that, having all my notes in once place will make studying a lot easier.
- What problem does it solve? It moved all my notes into an easy to read display, and helped me understand what it might be like to be a web developer
- What did you learn? I learned a lot of the basics about Github, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git. I improved on the little that I did know about coding, and I'll use the knowledge I gained doing this to help wtih more projects like this in the future!
